### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kristina and I focus on developing and testing user interfaces on responsive websites. I really enjoy learning languages and frameworks like React and React Native, as well as work in WordPress. I also enjoy wireframing, UI, UX, and design in general. Currently, I'm looking for new opportunities and challenges. Whether you have a question or just want to say hi, Iâ€™ll try my best to get back to you!
